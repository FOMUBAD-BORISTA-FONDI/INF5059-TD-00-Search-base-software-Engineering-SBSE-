# üöÄ TD00 - Algorithms Project

This project contains **JavaScript implementations** of fundamental algorithms given as assignments, allowing users to **interactively choose** an algorithm and enter their own data to see the results.

## üìå Some Features

‚úî **Dynamic User Input** ‚Äì Users can enter their own values for each algorithm.  
‚úî **Menu-Based Navigation** ‚Äì Select an algorithm from the menu to run it.  
‚úî **Efficient Algorithm Implementations** ‚Äì Includes Searching, Graph Traversal, Dynamic Programming, Sorting, and Optimization.  
‚úî **Beginner-Friendly** ‚Äì Structured and well-commented code for learning purposes.

## üõ† **Installation and Setup**

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Clone the Repository**

1. Run the following command to **download the project**:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/FOMUBAD-BORISTA-FONDI/INF5059-TD-00-Search-base-software-Engineering-SBSE-.git
cd INF5059-TD-00-Search-base-software-Engineering-SBSE-
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Run the Program

1. Run the following command to **execute the project**:

```sh
node app.js
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ How to Use the Menu

1. When you start the program, you will see::

```sh
=== Algorithms Project done in JavaScript===
1Ô∏è  Binary Search
2Ô∏è  Graph Traversal (BFS & DFS)
3Ô∏è  Knapsack Problem
4Ô∏è  Merge Intervals
5Ô∏è  Kadane‚Äôs Algorithm
0Ô∏è  Exit

Enter the number of the exercise you want to run:

```

- Select an option (1‚Äì5) and press ENTER.

The program will ask for input values, process them, and display results.

- After execution, the menu reloads so you can try another algorithm.
- Enter 0 to exit.
